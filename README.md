# Accountability Bot

## Overview

Accountability Bot is a decentralized accountability platform built on Near Protocol. It enables users to stake money towards personal or group goals, ensuring commitment through financial incentives. Users can participate in challenges like weight loss, work goals, and marathons, with funds being distributed based on completion.

**Lit Protocol’s PKP** system ensures security through a distributed key management approach. Instead of storing private keys in a single location, PKPs are managed across a decentralized network of nodes using cryptography.
We have used the Lit protocol’s PKP to store the private keys of challenge’s wallet addresses so that not even the challengers can access after deploying it

## Features

- **Discord Integration:** Users interact through a familiar Discord bot interface.
- **Secure Staking:** Participants deposit funds in USDC.
- **Trustless Verification:** Results are verified by other members.
- **Fair Distribution:** Winners redeem funds while non-completers forfeit.
- **Group and Individual Bets:** Create or join accountability challenges with friends or organizations.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Bet:** A user sets up a challenge with rules and deposit amount.
2. **Join a Bet:** Participants stake USDC by sending a deposit transaction.
3. **Verify Participation:** Users confirm their deposit via transaction hash.
4. **Track Progress:** The challenge runs for a specified period.
5. **Submit Results:** Participants submit proof of completion.
6. **Validate Results:** Other members verify and approve valid submissions.
7. **Distribute Funds:** Winners redeem their share; forfeited funds are split among completers.

## Technology Stack

- **Accounts:** Powered by Near Protocol
- **Blockchain:** Near chain / USDC transactions for secure deposits
- **Backend:** Node.js with PostgreSQL
